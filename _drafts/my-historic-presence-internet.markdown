One of the greatest things on the internet is [archive.org's Wayback machine][1], which allows to 
have a glance on how the web looked like in the past.

So here I present my own history on the _Internet_ :)

My initial steps took place around the 1998 in the now defunct but all glorious on its time: _geocities.com_, unfortunately I couldn't find any archived information about it.

Then around the 2000 I moved to an spanish free hosting service by the name of _demasiado.com_. The site was only
active there for a few months, however they refused to take it down until they went out of business in 2008.

On my stay in London and as soon as I could earn enough to get Internet access at home, I decided to buy
my own domain, _drslump.net_, and a cheap shared hosting. A few months later the hosting company remove the site
and didn't allow me the keep the domain after I uploaded some Sigur RÃ³s mp3s by mistake!

Some time later, back in Spain, I decided to buy a domain with the new .biz extension. So my home on the net became _drslump.biz_.

Then on April 2004 my shared hosting was hacked by some _Sidewinder_, something which I found quite funny and 
leaved it like that until the hosting contract ended a year later.

Yet on 2004 I decided to stop maintaining a personal site and instead started to use the company site.

Also in 2004, together with [Haripako][] we created _difundefirefox.com_ as a clone of _spreadfirefox.com_ to
help spread the use of Firefox in Spain and latin-american countries.

On 2005 there were some large changes in the company.

The use of the company site as an internet presence took more weight on 2006 when we started blogging on it,
keeping it updated for over two years.

From 2008 I decided it was time again to have my own personal site, so my current home was born: _pollinimini.net_.
Unfortunately _archive.org_ doesn't seem work after 2008, which means that I don't have any way to see the 
evolution of the current site, a pity.
