After being trying to get an [iphone][1] for a couple of months and haven't succeed
at it, I sat down and did an extensive research on the market offerings for my
needs. Finally I found what I needed and to my surprise it wasn't the phone with
the Apple logo.

I spend more than two hours each day on the train which gets absolutely packed
at rush hours, so my plan to work on the laptop while traveling is not a feasible
option (Even with my smallish [Dell XPS M1330][2]). Checking email and rss feeds on
my [Sony Ericsson K800i][3] cellphone works but with the huge amount of tunnels
in the trip the data connection keeps falling and the screen is not that big as
to make it a nice experience. So I decided to try with the Apple's phone which
should offer a great experience while on the move with its large touch screen
and the ability to sync imap accounts for offline reading of the inbox and nice
rss reading. Since I couldn't obtain one I searched on the net for alternatives
and I felt in love with Nokia's N810 internet tablet device.

The [N810][4] is not a smart phone, it just offers Wifi and Bluetooth radios so
it needs to tether with a phone to access mobile data networks. It does offer
however a wonderful touch screen sporting a 800Ã—480 resolution with an amazing
225dpi (quite good for [ebook reading][5]), a full qwerty keyboard and a Linux based
([Maemo][6]) operating system with a ton of available [third party application
and games][7]. What I like the most about the device is that its environment is
really open, which will allow me to tinker with it and suit it best to my needs.

So yesterday I placed the order on Nokia's online shop for it and I should be
enjoying this wonderful device next week. A big big big thanks to Cristina for
giving me this great present!
