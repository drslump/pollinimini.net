I've just spend an hour chatting with Daniel Mota (aka [IceBeat][1]) about his
project [CSSing][2]. I’ve been following its developement for some months now,
in fact I started my own version, MacroCSS, since he didn’t have released the
source code at that time.

I didn’t have the time to continue the development of MacroCSS, I did manage
though to implement a SAC based parser for CSS which turned out to be quite
powerful. IceBeat was searching with a [post][3] in his blog for a replacement
for his regular expression based parser. I pointed him to MacroCSS and he was
quite impressed with it.

After chatting with him I’m quite happy, not just because he liked my parser
but because we almost share the same vision for this project. Since as I said,
I don’t have the time to continue the development of MacroCSS on my own, I’m
deprecating it and I’ll focus on helping IceBeat with CSSing in what I can.

I really think this project could be a real hit for the web development comunity,
it fits really well with other ‘web 2.0’ (hell, how much I hate that term)
technologies like ajax (I hate this one even more). So if anyone is reading
this and wants to help out, he/she will be more than welcome.
