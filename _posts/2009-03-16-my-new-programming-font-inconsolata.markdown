Just a short post to announce a jewel I've just found. The [Inconsolata font][1] is
a great monospace font suitable to use in text terminals and code editors or IDEs.

It's replacing now the ancient Mac's Monaco which has served damn well over the
years but I feel like I needed a change and Inconsolata feels bolder and more
vibrant than Monaco or Microsoft's Consolas.

Update: This font was initially conceived for printing so it doesn't perform
well at small sizes, so to get it at its full glory I recommed a size of at
least 12 points over a dark background.
